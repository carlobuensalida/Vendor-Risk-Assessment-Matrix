# Vendor-Risk-Assessment-Matrix
A dynamic Excel tool for assessing and visualizing vendor risk levels in seconds 

---

## 🔑 Key Features  

- **Automated Risk Rating** – Select the **Probability** and **Impact** of a risk from drop-down lists, and the sheet instantly returns the correct **Risk Rating** (e.g., “Moderate,” “Critical,” “Sustainable”).  
- **Built-in Visualization & Counting** – A dynamic risk matrix automatically counts and displays how many risks fall into each category at a glance.  
- **Inherent & Residual Risk Tracking** – See both your starting (inherent) risk and what remains after controls (residual risk) side by side.  
- **Flexible Risk Categories** – Sustainable, Moderate, Severe, and Critical risks are pre-defined, but you can easily change labels or scales in the matrix and the entire sheet updates automatically.  
- **Master Probability & Impact Matrix** – Everything feeds from one master matrix so updates are seamless and consistent across the sheet.

## 🛠️ How It Works  

- **INDEX & MATCH** formulas compare the selected Probability and Impact to return the correct Risk Rating from the master matrix.  
- **COUNTIFS** formulas tally how many risks you have per category for quick visual dashboards (for both inherent and residual risks).  
- **Heatmaps** display risk levels clearly, highlighting areas needing attention.
